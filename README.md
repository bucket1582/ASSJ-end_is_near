## For development

This project mainly use `pnpm` + `Vite` + `React` + `typescript`.

### pnpm installation

Make sure that you've installed pnpm in your device. For pnpm installation, please refer to their [official document](https://pnpm.io/installation).

### `env.ts` setting

You need to make `src/utils/env.ts` which contains notion page id and api key. Write down as follows:

```typescript
export const PAGE_ID = '<Our notion page id>';
export const NOTION_API_KEY =  '<Our notion api key>';
```

You can check page id (32 characters) from the url of the notion page. Here's the way to check the page id from url.

You can make your own api key (<https://www.notion.so/my-integrations/>) or, can contact me if you're not the owner of the page.
